- Trying to get pipeline for beatmap generation
  - want: `beatextract song.mp3 > song.beats.txt` which dumps beats as textual labels (1.8723487)
  - want: `beatcompine song.mp3 song.beats.txt` which adds beatmap as IDv4 tag to mp3
  - want: loading a track with a beatmap automatically puts into transport

- Tried BTrack, but it's just a C++ library where samples are fed

- Trying to install audioowl for beat analysis
% python3 -m pip install audioowl==0.0.14 --no-build-isolation
 Doesn't build because of C++ compile errors
 madmom apparenty pre-dates proper build isolation
 
- beat detection on microcontrollers
https://github.com/Steppschuh/Micro-Beat-Detection

- Define model in Wasm (state, actions) and make the GUI (view) outside of Wasm, controls are exported action functions
- Define authoritative *state* in Wasm
 - e.g. a JS/Dom button's state is determined by a pointer into Wasm memory
 - e.g. place in track, chords and beats, strum pattern
 - make readable from UI
 - can only update with actions
- GUI polls the state of buttons very cheaply as part of update
- Guarantees that button state reflects internal Wasm state
