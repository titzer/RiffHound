- Trying to get pipeline for beatmap generation
  - want: `beatextract song.mp3 > song.beats.txt` which dumps beats as textual labels (1.8723487)
  - want: `beatcompine song.mp3 song.beats.txt` which adds beatmap as IDv4 tag to mp3
  - want: loading a track with a beatmap automatically puts into transport

- Tried BTrack, but it's just a C++ library where samples are fed

- Trying to install audioowl for beat analysis
% python3 -m pip install audioowl==0.0.14 --no-build-isolation
 Doesn't build because of C++ compile errors
 madmom apparenty pre-dates proper build isolation
