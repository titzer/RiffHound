Interactions between RiffHound components

RiffHound components consists of software and hardware that all participate in a jam.

1. Sound Generators (Playback Engines)
Modules that produce musical audio or MIDI in time with the system.

Examples:
- Drum Engine
- Harmony Engine (chords)
- Melody Engine
- MIDI Synth / Sequencer Engine

These are the “actuators” of musical sound.

2. Visual Displays (Performer Interfaces)
Modules that render information for performers or operators.

Examples:
- Rhythm Display
- Score Display
- Tab Display
- Lead Line Display
- Chord Display
- Lyrics Display

Their role is informational, not generative.

3. Sensors / Capture Modules (Audio & Control Inputs)
Modules that ingest external signals—audio, control, or performance gestures.

Examples:
- Audio Capture (mics, DI, line-in)
- MIDI Capture
- Instrument Sensors (piezo, pickups, contact mics)
- Multi-track Capture
- Automatic transcription

These are the system’s “ears.”

4. Creative Generators / Algorithmic Actuators

Modules that produce new musical material or transformations algorithmically.

Examples:
- Generative Accompaniment Engine
- Adaptive Performance Engine
- Pattern Transformer / Filler / Improviser
- AI Melody or Drum Line Generator

These influence or inject creative musical events into the system.

5. Editors (Control Consoles)
Modules that allow performers, producers, or mixers to modify the musical state, either globally or per-component.
Think of these as the user-facing control surfaces for configuring patterns, sounds, displays, or routing.

Examples:
- Pattern Editor (drums, chords, melodies)
- Mixer Console (levels, panning, effects)
- Arrangement Editor (sections, transitions, repeats)
- Tempo/Timing Console (BPM, swing, quantization)
- Instrument Configurator (synth parameters, timbre)
- Lyrics/Score Annotation Editor

Editors don’t produce sound themselves; they shape what the other modules will do.
