RiffHound components analysis

RiffHound components consists of software and hardware that all participate in a jam.

1. Sound Generators (Playback Engines)
Modules that produce musical audio or MIDI in time with the system.

Examples:
- Drum Machine
- Harmony Engine (chords)
- Strum machine
- Melody Engine
- MIDI Synth / Sequencer Engine

These are the "actuators" of musical sound that are used in a variety of practice, play,
or performance use cases. 
Parameters: volume, pitch shift, playback speed

2. Visual Displays (Performer Interfaces)
Modules that render information for performers or operators.

Examples:
- Rhythm Display
- Score Display
- Tab Display
- Lead Line Display
- Chord Display
- Lyrics Display
- Spectrogram

These displays cue performers, organizing and presenting musical information in an animated
display that keeps them synced. May be coupled with specific sound generators.
Parameters: many, user configurable display

3. Sensors / Capture Modules (Audio & Control Inputs)
Modules that ingest external signals—audio, control, or performance gestures.

Examples:
- Audio Capture (mics, DI, line-in)
- MIDI Capture
- Instrument Sensors (piezo, pickups, contact mics)
- Multi-track Capture
- Automatic transcription

These are the system’s "ears."
Parameters: various, including level

4. Creative Generators / Algorithmic Actuators

Modules that produce new musical material or transformations algorithmically.

Examples:
- Generative Accompaniment Engine
- Adaptive Performance Engine
- Pattern Transformer / Filler / Improviser
- AI Melody or Drum Line Generator

These influence or inject creative musical events into the system.
Parameters: many

5. Editors (Control Consoles)
Modules that allow performers, producers, or mixers to modify the musical state, either globally or per-component.
Think of these as the user-facing control surfaces for configuring patterns, sounds, displays, or routing.

Examples:
- Pattern Editor (drums, chords, melodies)
- Mixer Console (levels, panning, effects)
- Arrangement Editor (sections, transitions, repeats)
- Tempo/Timing Console (BPM, swing, quantization)
- Instrument Configurator (synth parameters, timbre)
- Lyrics/Score Annotation Editor

Editors don’t produce sound themselves; they shape what the other modules will do.
Parameters: many

6. Connections
Connections between modules allow multiple tools to cooperate.

Examples:
- MIDI input/output from DAW to keyboard
- Digital audio input/output from DAW to line in/out
- MIDI interface between sequencer and drum machine

7. Time model + tempo control

Examples:
- step/stepped time: series of beats or measures
- physical time: seconds or milliseconds
- loops: one or more looping constructs
- speed change: resampling or analog
Parameters: master tempo control

8. Composition and Sequencing
Handling elements at multiple granularities and temporal seqence control.

Examples:
- playlist
- looping constructs
- crossfade / mix

9. Annotations
Attaching notes, cues, or other information to playback.

Examples:
- beat map
- cueing notes
