Original lyrics

I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin'
I try to make believe there's nothing wrong
But they're always asking me about you darling
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone
If they ask me I guess I'd be denyin'
that I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darling, when's she coming home

I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
But I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining through
And that I get so doggone lonesome

Time stands still when you're a waitin'
sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever
sixty minutes more to wait for you
But I guess I'll keep waitin' till you're with me
cause I believe that loving you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
if I can't have you with me tonight

Well I know I'll keep on loving you
cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind
but I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others
but I know I'd love you still
Cause I get so doggone lonesome

Verse 1
I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin’
I try to make believe there’s nothing wrong
But they’re always asking me about the build time
And it hurts me so to tell ’em it’s so long

If they ask me I guess I’d be denyin’
That my compile is draggin’ all dog slow
But if they heard my fan they’d hear it cryin’
Where's my dot-oh's where's the dot-ess-o

Chorus
I ask myself a million times what’s right for me to do
To try to trim the code alone, or wait around for you
But I make it pretty good until that linker’s breaking through
And then it gets so doggone bloated

Verse 2
Time stands still when you are waitin’
Sometimes I think the hard drive’s stoppin’ too
One lonely dot-oh takes forever
Sixty thousand more to link with you

But I guess I’ll wait on Ninja till it’s finished
’Cause I believe that shippin’ code is right
But I don’t care if the sun don’t rise tomorrow
If I can't have my lib link tonight

Verse 3
Well I know I’ll keep on patchin’ you
’Cause true bugs can’t be killed
I oughta strip you out sometime
But I guess I never will
I could have a dozen modules
But I’d recompile them still
’Cause it is so doggone bloated
