Lyrics by B. Lawrence Titzer

Well I trained myself for heartbreak
  been practicing my whole life through
What a young bright boy I was
  those days I had with you

I guess they call it naive-tee
I don't really know
But how naive could one man be
When he's had to take the blows

..and

Trained himself for heartbreak
  in every love he never had

Trained himself for heartbreak
  in every love he never had

Trained himself for heartbreak
  in every love he never had

I wonder when
Oh, I wonder when...

<guitar solo>
