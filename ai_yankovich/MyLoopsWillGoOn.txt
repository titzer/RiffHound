Original lyrics

Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
    And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'til we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life, we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on (why does the heart go on?)
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart and
My heart will go on and on

Version 1
Every night when I code
I see you: while (true)
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
No changes to globals
You have come to show you got stuck

Chorus
Loop, spin, forever again
I believe that the loop does go on
Once more, you ignore the store
And the flag is not clear
And I fear it runs on and on

Verse 2
Code can trap us one time
And hang for a lifetime
And never break out ’til RAM's gone
Dreamed we’d write the function
That can say “it ends here”
But the truth is, Turing said no

Chorus
Calls, deep, forever recurse
I believe that the stack does go on
Once more, exceptions are thrown
But the handler ignores
And the stack will go on and on

Bridge
You’re here, all cores are on fire
And I know that the loop will go on
We’ll spin forever this way
You are stuck and it lags and
My fans will roar on and on
