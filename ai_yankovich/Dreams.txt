Original Lyrics:
==================================================================

Verse 1:
Now here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully
To the sound of your loneliness

Pre-chorus:
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Chorus:
Oh, thunder only happens when it's rainin'
Players only love you when they're playin'
Say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Verse 2
Now here I go again
I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

Pre-chorus:
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Ooh, what you lost

Chorus:
Thunder only happens when it's rainin'
Players only love you when they're playin'
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Oh, thunder only happens when it's rainin'
Players only love you when they're playin'
Say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Outro:
You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know

Verse 1
Now here you code again
You say you want to program
Well, who am I to slow you down?
It’s only right that you should
Run it in debug mode
But listen carefully
To the sound of your last core dump

Pre-chorus:
Like a stack trace drives you mad
In the silence of the screen that screams all that hex
And all that mess
And all that hex
And all that mess

Chorus
Oh, crashing only happens when it’s buggy
Failures only haunt you when they’re ugly
Say errors, they will come and they will go
When the logs don't show up clean, you’ll know
You’ll know

Verse 2
Now here I go again
I chase the phantom pointer
I keep my printfs to myself
It’s only me who needs to dig around your code
And have you any hacks you’d like to share?
Dreams of Heisenbugs
