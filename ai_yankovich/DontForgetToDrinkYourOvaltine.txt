[1980s pop tune in the style of "Girls just want to have fun".
Light hearted keyboards and synths with a rhythmic hook.
Female lead voice with a bit of an echo effect.
Chorus has well-known dance moves that sweep the nation.]

[intro]

[verse]
Last night I dreamt of Word 95
It was bliss...
This evening I tried to make chili
Searched the recipe...
And it was ads
ads ads ads

[Chorus]
Don't forget to drink your ovaltine
Don't forget to drink your ovaltine
A crummy commercial

[Verse]
Yesterday my sister asked me
Can you pick me up from
Mcrady's auto
I asked my phone for the way
And it gave me ads
ads ads ads

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Sometimes I think that
Computers should do what we ask for
Instead of what they want for us
And what some asshole paid them to show us instead

[Outro]
[Spoken]
Just look it up in the phone book
Get the address
I know that street
It's on the 500 block?
Ah that's two blocks away from somewhere I know.

I CAN COUNT
I CAN COUNT
I CAN COUNT

[Chorus Reprise]
Odd on the left, even on the right...
Odd on the left, even on the right...
Odd on the left, even on the right...

and use my eyes...

[Chorus]
Don't forget to drink your ovaltine
Don't forget to drink your ovaltine
A crummy commercial
Stuff it up your ass
